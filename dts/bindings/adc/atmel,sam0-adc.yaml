        bit position offset in NVM SW Calib for start of ADC0 BIASCOMP field.
        This property is expected to be set on SAM{D,E}5x family of SoCs.
        For ADC0 this should be 0, and for ADC1 this should be 14.
      enum:
        - 0
        - 14
    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      description: |
        PIO pin configuration for adc pin and channel.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<chan>_<signal>.

        For example the I2C0 on SAMD21 would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa9d_adc_chan19>;
