      description: |
        PIO pin configuration for pwm pin and channel.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_wo<output_number>.
        For example the PWM on SAMD21 would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa12f_pwm_wo6>;
